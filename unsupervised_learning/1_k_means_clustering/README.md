# Project Description
The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999. Because its postal offices have to look at roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and understanding addresses.  
In this project, you will be using K-means clustering and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits.

## Python libraries:
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
